In order to keep myself on track I wanted to document my workflow. So in order
to do that this post will be kept up to date every 3 months or so with
additional input and changes to how I work. Currently, I use NixOS and have my
Neovim config managed through Nix, a big thanks to
[@nekowinson](https://github.com/nekowinston) for all their help.

To start right away with things that I wish to get better at:

- vim motions
- touch typing
- Go
- Rust
- Nix

This list were created in order to improve my basic workflow to improve the
generic speed that I work at. To start I barely use vim motions despite using
Neovim as my main editor, and touch typing goes along well with this. And
despite using NixOS I feel like I barely know anything about Nix.

In order to also properly manage myself I have two main tools
[bellado](https://github.com/isabelroses/bellado) and
[Vikunja](https://vikunja.io) having these two separate is really inconvenient
but in order to use my to-do list well it needs to be accessible via the command
line and through the web so whether I'm out and about or on my main work machine
every will work well. One way I plan to improve this issue is to allow bellado
to interact with my Vikunja instance.
