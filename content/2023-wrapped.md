During the course of 2023, I learnt and did a lot of different things. And this post is here to summarise the most important things that I did and learnt.

So to start off with, I started with using Git and GitHub _properly_, to be accurate I used to commit to GitHub rarely and doing so with the web upload by dragging and dropping files. I was also introduced to forking and pull requests thanks to the amazing community over at [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).

From now on were going to swap to a list format as it will be easier to read, and break it down into different sections.

### New technologies

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io), the best editor ever. This now is my main editor, and I'm really happy with it. I'm still learning how to use it properly but I'm getting there. In fact I'm writing this post in Neovim right now. Prior to this I was using [VC Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and from time to time I still do, but I find myself using Neovim more and more.
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), my main operating system, and it has made development so much easier.
- [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io), this functioned as my main to-do list manager, but I would like to start using [bellado](https://github.com/isabelroses/bellado) as a way to interact with my Vikunja instance. The reason for this is I need to use my to-do list on the move more often then not. But I also love being in the command line and a easy way to do this would be amazing.

### Self hosted services

I started getting into self hosting services (all managed by my NixOS dotfiles) this year and I got really excited and ended up hosting more the I actually use but I'm still happy with the outcome. However, some of the ones I use the most are:

- [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/), its a really cool Git service that is light weight and easy to use. I use it for _most_ my Git hosting needs.
- My mailserver, although this was a real pain to setup, I use this one of the most out of all my self hosted services.
- [wakatime](https://wakatime.com), this is a really cool service that I use to track my coding time. I use this to see how much time I spend coding and what languages I use the most.
- [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io) as mentioned above, this is my main to-do list manager. I use this to keep track of all my tasks and what I need to do.
- And finally, [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), an amazing open-source password manager, which saved me so many times.

### New languages

This year I learnt a wide range of languages since I was in search for the prefect language for me. And I think I found it, but I'm still learning it. But the languages that I learnt this year were:

- [Go](https://golang.org/), this is my main language now, and I'm really happy with it.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), this is a really cool language, but I don't use it as much as I would like to, but I have made a few projects in it.
- [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), this is a language that I dint really like as much as a I thought, but I still learnt it and made a few small projects in it.

### New Projects

Some of the projects that I worked on during 2023 were:

- [catppuccin/userstyles](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles), a collection of userstyles for various websites. This was my first _proper_ project that I worked on and I learnt a lot from it. And its still one of my favourite projects to work on, it currently has (at the time of writing) 51 styles and 29 people working on it. And I'm really proud of it, and I was happy to be able to work on it with such an amazing community.
- [my website](https://github.com/isabelroses/website), a cool website that I made in vue.js and now am in the process of remaking in go. I learnt a lot from this project and I'm really happy with how it turned out, but you can be my judge of that.
- [bellado](https://github.com/isabelroses/bellado), a command line to-do list manager. This is one of the hardest projects that I have worked on, and I'm really thankful to the Catppuccin community once again for all the help making this a much easier job, in particular [@nullishamy](https://github.com/nullishamy), she really was the best of help.
- [my dotfiles](https://github.com/isabelroses/dotfiles), my [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) dotfiles. This is one of the hardest things that I've done all year, there was so much to learn and so much to do. I'm really happy that I completed this and I am really happy to be using NixOS as my main operating system.
- [rerefined](https://github.com/isabelroses/rerefined), I don't often mention this one since I don't update it that much but its purpose is to make a visual improvement to multiple websites.
